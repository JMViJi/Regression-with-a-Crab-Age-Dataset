    "# 1.Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we will dive deep into the intriguing world of crab farming. It is a popular and economically rewarding activity, especially in coastal regions, with lower labor and production costs, quick growth, and a large market for consumption. But, to achieve an optimum balance between cost and profit, one crucial element that farmers need to estimate accurately is the age of the crab. Precise age determination aids in knowing the right time to harvest the crabs, ensuring the best utilization of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Problem Summary\n",
    "The main problem we are addressing is predicting the age of the crab based on its physical attributes. This regression problem, given its real-world implications and the need for precise results, calls for a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), adept feature engineering, and robust regression modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Dataset\n",
    "The dataset we have contains a total of 3893 observations across several physical characteristics of crabs. Each observation is an individual crab with features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sex\n",
    "- Length (in feet)\n",
    "- Diameter (in feet)\n",
    "- Height (in feet)\n",
    "- Weight (in ounces)\n",
    "- Shucked Weight (Weight without the shell, in ounces)\n",
    "- Viscera Weight (Weight of the abdominal organs, in ounces)\n",
    "- Shell Weight (in ounces)\n",
    "- Age (in months)\n",
    "  \n",
    "The data seems to be clean without any missing or mismatched values. A preliminary overview shows a diverse set of values across different features, hinting at potential patterns and correlations that could be instrumental in our modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3.Feature Characteristics\n",
    "A brief overview of the feature characteristics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sex: The dataset is almost evenly split across the three categories: Male (37%), Female (32%), and Indeterminate (31%).\n",
    "- Length, Diameter, Height, Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight, and Shell Weight: These features showcase a range of values, with different means, standard deviations, and quantiles. A more in-depth analysis will help in understanding their distributions and potential impact on the age of the crab.\n",
    "- Age: The age of the crab ranges from 1 month to 29 months, with a mean of approximately 9.95 months. The data skews towards younger crabs, with a significant number of crabs aged between 6.60 to 12.20 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4.Methodology\n",
    "The methodology for this analysis will consist of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The aim here is to understand the distribution of data, correlations between different features, and detect any potential outliers or anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: This stage involves generating new features that might help improve the model's accuracy. These can be combinations of existing features or transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Building: We will try out various regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, etc., to predict the age of the crab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and error analysis to see how well our model is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Tuning: This includes tuning hyperparameters for better performance and applying techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process will be iteratively performed until we arrive at a satisfactory model for predicting the age of the crab."
